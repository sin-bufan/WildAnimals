A small number of them can be seen in Ladakh, India. Thanks to the concern and protection of Chinese government and society, the population has gradually recovered from near extinction.</p><p>Fuwa Yingying, one of the mascots of 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, was designed in imitation of the Tibetan antelope to praise its tenacious vitality of living in harsh environment, and highlight its spirit of challenging the limits of survivability. Moreover, its Chinese name contains the Chinese character “yang”, with a meaning of “bursting with happiness”. </p>",

      "text": "<p> In 1981, China joined the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, strictly prohibiting all trade-oriented exports of Tibetan antelopes and their products. In 1988, the Tibetan antelope was identified as a State Class I protected species, and hunting was strictly prohibited. The Xining Declaration on the Conservation of and Control of Trade in Tibetan Antelope was formally released at a corresponding international symposium in Xining in Qinghai Province in 1999, marking the beginning of international cooperation in combating the poaching of Tibetan antelopes and stopping illegal international trade in Tibetan antelope cashmere products. This greatly promoted the protection of the species. The Chinese government has successively established a number of nature reserves such as Qinghai Hoh Xil National Nature Reserve, Xinjiang Altun Mountain National Nature Reserve and Tibet Changtang National Nature Reserve in the important distribution areas of Tibetan antelopes, and established special protection management institutions and a law enforcement team to regularly conduct mountain patrols and monitor the activities of the antelope populations. In September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lowered the status of Tibetan antelopes from an “endangered species” to a “near-threatened species”. </p><p>Heavenly Roads and Migration Routes of Tibetan Antelopes</p><p>For the social and economic development and the improvement of living standards of various ethnic groups in Tibet, the Chinese government successively built the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, known as “heavenly roads” because of their high altitude. However, they inevitably caused divisions in the ecological environment, which had a certain impact on the migration of Tibetan antelopes, such as delays in the process. For this reason, the wildlife passage was first introduced in the design and construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. There were 33 animal passages planned along the whole route. Observational studies have shown that over time, the adaptability of Tibetan antelopes to these passages is gradually increasing, playing a positive role in their lives on the plateau.</p>"

      "intro": "As the last wild horse in the world, Przewalski’s horse is considered a living fossil, a world-class star species under protection. It once disappeared in China due to environmental changes. In the 1980s, China cooperated with the international community and introduced specimens to China for artificial breeding. In 2001, the offspring were successfully released in the wild.",

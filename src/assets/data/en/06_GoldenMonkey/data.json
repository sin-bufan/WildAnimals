      "intro": "There are five kinds of golden monkeys in the world, all featuring a snub nose, so the Latin name means “snub-nosed monkey.” Among them, Sichuan golden monkeys, Yunnan golden monkeys and Guizhou golden monkeys are unique to China. Because of the golden hairs of Sichuan golden monkeys, Chinese people used to call them “golden monkeys”, and as a result, all the species that were later designated as “snub-nosed monkeys” were covered by this common name.",

Researchers believe that there may be two reasons: first, female Yunnan golden monkeys may prefer males with red lips when picking a mate; and second, the male’s lip color as a sign of their status can reduce conflict: the paler the lips, the less threatening the monkey appears. This makes the breeding male monkeys target rivals with bright red lips.",

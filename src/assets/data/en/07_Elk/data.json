Shortly after being discovered by some Westerners, they were captured by the Eight-Power Allied Forces and disappeared from China. Some elks were purchased by the U.K. until 1898, expanding to a herd of 255. In the 1980s, some elks were sent back to China, often for release in the wild.</p><p>From 1985 to 1986, China imported a total of 77 elks from the United Kingdom. By now, the population of elks has grown to nearly 5,000. </p><p>In order to ensure save living conditions for elks that had returned to China, the government has established several national nature reserves and nature conservation stations. At the four native habitats of elks in three provinces, including Jiangsu and Hubei, four groups of nearly a thousand wild elks were restored, the first time in 150 years to see wild elks in China. As the population grew, the elks’ reproductive rate, survival rate, annual growth rate and other indicators ranked first in the world. </p><p>The Chinese people also maintain a good sense of protection for the elks, and expect them to continue to live freely on their native land.</p>"
